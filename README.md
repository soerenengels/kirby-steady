## Documentation

### Site method: $site->steady()

The site method `$site->steady()` or the Steady helper function `steady()` give you access to the [Steady Class](https://github.com/soerenengels/kirby-steady/blob/main/classes/Steady.php) and its following methods:

- `->publication()`
- `->plans()`
- `->subscriptions()`
- `->newsletter_subscribers()`
- `->report($id)`
- `->widget()`

### Panel: Steady-Reports

Simply add Steady reports to your panel via a the stats section or as individual reports.  
Following reports are available:

- Members
- Newsletter Subscriptions
- Monthly Revenue

#### Example: Usage of the Steady Reports in a custom stats section

```yml
section:
  steady_section:
    type: stats
    label: My Custom Steady reports
    size: huge
    reports:
      - site.steady.report('members') # For total members report
      - site.steady.report('newsletter_subscribers') # For newsletter subscribers report
      - site.steady.report('revenue') # For monthly revenue report
```

### $block Plans

You can simply add a **Steady: Plans** `$block` by adding it to your fieldsets.

You can use the predefined Snippets in `/snippets/components/steady/*.php` to render following components:

- All public Plans
- A single plan by `$id`

#### Example: Add Plans $block to your fieldsets

```yml
sections:
  content:
    fields:
      text:
        # ...
        type: blocks
        fieldsets:
          - steady_plans
          - ...
```

#### Example: Display all plans or a single plan via a `$snippet`

```php
// Display all plans
snippet('components/steady/plans', [
  'plans' => $steady->plans()->plans // array of Plan objects
]);
```

```php
// Display a single plan by id
snippet('components/steady/plan', [
  'plan' => $steady->plans()->find($id) // Plan object
]);
```

#### Style your plans

The styling of the plans is up to you. For the HTML markup structure and classes see [`/snippets/components/steady/plans.php`](https://github.com/soerenengels/kirby-steady/blob/main/snippets/components/steady/plans.php) and [`/snippets/components/steady/plan.php`](https://github.com/soerenengels/kirby-steady/blob/main/snippets/components/steady/plan.php). If you want to change the markup of the plans, you can overwrite those components by creating a new file in `/site/snippets/components/steady/{name-of-file-you-want-to-overwrite}.php`.

### Steady-Paywall

To use the Steady Paywall block, you need to **activate it** in your Steady settings (Integrations > Steady Paywall), **add it** to your blocks fieldsets **and integrate** the Steady Javascript Widget.

#### Example: Add Paywall to your blocks fieldsets

```yml
sections:
  content:
    fields:
      text:
        # ...
        type: blocks
        fieldsets:
          - steady_paywall
          - ...
```

### Adblock detection

If you have set the `widget` option to `true` in the `config.php` options, you can configure the Steady Adblock detection at your publication settings on the Steady website.

### Snippet: Login button

If you have set the `widget` option to `true` in the `config.php` options, you can integrate the Steady login button on your website via a snippet.

Visitors, who have not logged in on your website already, see this button. After they click it, a login page opens. Visitors, who are logged in already, can logout themselves with the same button.

#### Example: Add the Steady Login button to your Website

```php
// Default: $data = ['size' => 'medium', 'language' => 'en']
snippet('components/steady/login');

// Custom
snippet('components/steady/login', [
  'size' => 'small',
  'language' => 'de'
]);
```

**Warning:** Do not use the Steady login button, if you implement the OAuth2-Flow manually. The button is programmed, that it works together with the Steady Javascript widget and shall not be used with a manual OAuth flow, as Steady states.
