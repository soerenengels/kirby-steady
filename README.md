      // Your private Steady REST API KEY
      // Get it from https://steadyhq.com/backend/publications/default/integrations/api/edit
      'token' => '...',

      // OPTIONAL
      // change to true, if you want to use login, paywall, sticky button or adblock detection
      // if true, you also need to add the Steady::widget() to your websites head
      'widget' => false,
      // If you want to, you can change the name of the cache, where the api requests will be saved
      // Default: 'steady-api'
      'cache' => 'steady-api',
    ]
  ]
]
```

## Documentation

### Site-Method: $site->steady()

The site method `$site->steady()` or the Steady helper function `steady()` give you access to the Steady Class and its following methods:

- `->publication()`
- `->plans()`
- `->subscriptions()`
- `->newsletter_subscribers()`
- `->report($id)`

### Panel: Steady-Reports

Simply add Steady reports to your panel via a the stats section or as individual reports.

Following reports are available:

- Members
- Newsletter Subscriptions
- Monthly Revenue

```yml
section:
  steady_section:
    type: stats
    label: My Steady reports
    size: huge
    reports:
      - site.steady.report('members') # For total members report
      - site.steady.report('newsletter_subscribers') # For newsletter subscribers report
      - site.steady.report('revenue') # For monthly revenue report
```

### $block Plans

You can simply add a **Steady: Plans** `$block` by adding it to your fieldsets.

You can use the predefined Snippets in `/snippets/components/steady/...` to render following components:

- All Plans
- A single plan

Examples

```php
// Display all plans
snippet('components/steady/plans', [
  'plans' => $steady->plans()->plans // array of Plan objects
]);
```

```php
// Display a single plan by id
snippet('components/steady/plan', [
  'plan' => $steady->plans()->find($id) // Plan object
]);
```

#### Style your plans

The styling of the plans is up to you. For the HTML markup structure and classes see `/snippets/components/steady/plans.php` and `/snippets/components/steady/plan.php`. If you want to change the markup of the plans, you can overwrite those components by creating a new file in `/site/snippets/components/steady/{name-of-file-you-want-to-overwrite}.php`.

### Steady-Paywall

To use the Steady Paywall block, you need to activate it in your Steady settings (Integrations > Steady Paywall), add it to your blocks fieldsets and integrate the Steady Javascript Widget.

Example:

```yml
sections:
  content:
    fields:
      text:
        # ...
        type: blocks
        fieldsets:
          - steady/paywall
          - ...
```

### Adblock detection

If you have set the `widget` option to `true` in the `config.php` options, you can configure the Steady Adblock detection at your publication settings on the Steady website.

### Snippet: Login button

If you have set the `widget` option to `true` in the `config.php` options, you can integrate the Steady login button on your website via a snippet.

Visitors, who have not logged in on your website already, see this button. After they click it, a login page opens. Visitors, who are logged in already, can logout themselves with the same button.

Example

```php
// Default (size: medium, language: en)
snippet('components/steady/login');

// Custom
snippet('components/steady/login', [
  'size' => 'small',
  'language' => 'fr'
]);
```

**Achtung:** Benutze den Button nicht, wenn du den OAuth2-Flow manuell implementierst. Der Button ist so programmiert, dass er automatisch mit unserem Javascript-Widget arbeitet und somit nicht f√ºr den manuellen Flow verwendet werden kann.
